Open311 APIs
============

Inquiry/Information beta
------------------------

### Spec: [Inquiry v1](/Inquiry_v1 "wikilink")

The Inquiry/Information API is meant to be accessed to retrieve non-GeoReport-related content. This can be used for information which is typically provided to callers of a 311 system as an answer to their question. It supports three fundamental capabilities: services, facilities, and a "311 today" (RSS) feed.

### Spec: [Inquiry v2 Draft](/Inquiry_v2_Draft "wikilink")

Version 2 is meant to provide a more generic version of the Inquiry/Information API with extended features.

GeoReport v2
------------

### Spec: [GeoReport v2](/GeoReport_v2 "wikilink")

#### Service Discovery

GeoReport v2 and following versions are meant to be accessed via the [Service Discovery](/Service_Discovery "wikilink") mechanism to identify the status and version number for available endpoints in each jurisdiction. The service discovery mechanism is a requirement of the specification, but is meant to be independent and persistant beyond the GeoReport v2 version of the spec.

Please view the [Service Discovery](/Service_Discovery "wikilink") specification.
